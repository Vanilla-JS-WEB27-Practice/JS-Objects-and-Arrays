        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ["Sean", "John", "Juan", "Joan"];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.

        // You might think we can just do something like this:

        // However, wht happens when we update that array?

        // Now here is the problem!

        // Oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array, not a an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // One way

        // Or create a new array and concat the old one in.

        // Or use the new ES6 Spread

        // Now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: "Sean",
            age: 99
        };

        // And we make a copy:

        // How do we take a copy instead?

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note, this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. Lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
