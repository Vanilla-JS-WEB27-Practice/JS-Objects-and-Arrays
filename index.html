        // 1. start with strings, numbers and booleans

        // let age = 100;
        // let age2 = age;

        // console.log(age, age2);
        
        // only updates age and not age2
        // age = 200;
        // console.log(age, age2);

        // let name = "Sean";
        // let name2 = name;

        // console.log(name, name2);

        // only updates name and not name2
        // name = "John";
        // console.log(name, name2);

        // Take away, when you update a string, number, or booly it DOES NOT reference back, only the value you changed, changes




        // 2. Let's say we have an array
        const players = ["Sean", "John", "Juan", "Joan"];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;

        console.log(players, team);

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        // team[3] = 'Lux'; // typed team and players in the console and both show that the name at position [3] change to 'Lux'

        // Take away, when you update an Array, it REFERENCES back and both change

        // However, wht happens when we update that array?

        // Now here is the problem!

        // Oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array, not a an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice();


        // One way

        // Or create a new array and concat the old one in.
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        // Or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];
        team4[3] = "Yeeeeee hawwwwww";
        console.log(team4);

        const team5 = Array.from(players);

        // Now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: "Sean",
            age: 99
        };

        // And we make a copy:

        // How do we take a copy instead?

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note, this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. Lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
